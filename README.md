# Project-FoSa
Recreating the source files to the equation cheat-sheets from FLURUS - the student council of the aerospace degree program at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

## Why does this project exist?
From finally vectorizing all the images to enable sharp quality printouts to letting people fix obvious mistakes on their own, this project arose with the goal of improvement in mind.
If you want to contribute, feel free to ask me for repo access!

### Advantages
- The whitespace of each document has been optimized to save the most precious thing when creating an Equation Cheat-Sheet: space.
- Each graphic has been re-created as a vector graphic, letting you a) fix possible mistakes and b) making it crisp after printing, all while c) colorizing each image for easier recognition.
- Useful notes have been added to each document, from CAS commands over simple page numbers to equation numbers, all in accordance with the respective lecture.
